## Project status:

Work is completed.


## Notes:

* I do not wish to share my phone number on the portfolio.

* I do not want to have the email too visible, people who will be on my portfolio will be directed here through my application to a job offer.

* I wish to expende my projects to my previous design and UI projets. I expect to have more detailed and unique project pages. This is why I am not going with a component for this feature.

Thanks for reading! ;)
